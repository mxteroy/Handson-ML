    "What if I need to tackle a complex problem, such as tetecting hundreds of types of objects in high-resolution images?\n",
    "- I would need to train a DNN with maybe 10 layers or many more w/ hundrds of neurons, linked by hundred of thousands of connections\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems I could run into:\n",
    "- May be faced with the tricky *vanishing gradients* problem or the related *exploding gradients* problem\n",
    "    - when the gradients grow smaller and smaller, or larger and larger, when flowing backward through the DNN during training\n",
    "    - makes training the lower layers (closer to inputs) much harder to train\n",
    "- Not enough training data for such a large network OR training data is there but is too costly to label\n",
    "- Training may be extremely slow\n",
    "- A model w/ millions of parameters would severely risk overfitting the training set, especially if there are not enough training instances (low # of features: # training instances ratio leads to overfitting) or those instances are too noisy\n",
