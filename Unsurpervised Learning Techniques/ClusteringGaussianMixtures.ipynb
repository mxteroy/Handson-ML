    "- A probabilitics model that assumes that the instances were generated from a mixture fo several Gaussian distribution whose parametres are unknown\n",
    "- All instances generated from as single Gaussian distribution form a cluster that typically looks like an ellipsoid\n",
    "    - each cluster can have a different ellipsoidal shape, size, densit, and orientation\n",
    "    - when observing an instance, it is generated from one of those Gaussian distributions, but it is unkown which one\n",
    "        - it is also unknown what the parameters are\n",
